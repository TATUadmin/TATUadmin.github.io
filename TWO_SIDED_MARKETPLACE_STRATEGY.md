# 🔄 TATU Two-Sided Marketplace Strategy

**Last Updated:** December 28, 2025  
**Status:** Core Strategic Framework

---

## 🎯 The Two-Sided Vision

**TATU is not just artist software—it's a marketplace connecting tattoo artists with clients.**

### **The Fundamental Insight:**

Most platforms pick one side:
- ❌ **Instagram** - Good for artists to showcase, bad for clients to book
- ❌ **Booksy** - Good for bookings, bad for artist discovery
- ❌ **Google Maps** - Good for finding shops, bad for seeing artist work

**TATU does both:**
- ✅ **For Clients:** Discover artists by style, see portfolios, message with confidence, book consultations
- ✅ **For Artists:** Get discovered by qualified clients, manage all communications, showcase unlimited work, book efficiently

**Result:** Network effects compound in both directions

## 👤 Client Side: The Discovery & Booking Experience

### **The Client Problem:**

**Current State (What Clients Experience Today):**

```
Client wants a Japanese half-sleeve tattoo in Denver:

Step 1: Search "japanese tattoo denver" on Instagram
├─ Scroll through 1000+ hashtag posts
├─ Can't filter by style, quality, or availability
├─ See random photos, not actual portfolios
└─ No way to know if artist is taking clients

Step 2: Find interesting artists, DM 5-10 of them
├─ Wait for responses (might never come)
├─ No idea if artist saw the message
├─ Can't see availability
└─ Stressful: "Did I DM the right artists?"

Step 3: Get 2-3 responses (after days/weeks)
├─ Try to schedule consultations
├─ Back-and-forth about dates/times
├─ Still unsure about artist fit
└─ Anxious about $2,000+ commitment

Step 4: Hope for the best
├─ Book with whoever responded fastest (not necessarily best fit)
├─ Stress about whether it's the right choice
└─ High anxiety until appointment day

Pain Points:
❌ No efficient way to search/filter artists
❌ No confidence that messages will be seen
❌ No way to video chat before committing
❌ No centralized place to compare artists
❌ High anxiety about $500-5,000 decision
```

├─ Website: Expensive, hard to maintain
├─ Google: Only shows shop, not individual artist
└─ No good way to showcase work

Booking & Scheduling:
├─ Manual back-and-forth via DM
├─ "When are you available?" → Check calendar → Reply
├─ Client books with someone else before you respond
└─ No centralized booking system

Client Management:
├─ No record of past conversations
├─ "Wait, did this client message me before?"
├─ No notes about client preferences
└─ Everything scattered across platforms

Pain Points:
